To create a form dynamically with JavaScript, we can use the document.createElement method to create the element.

Then we can use the setAttribute method to set the element attributes.

Then we can use the appendChild method to append the elements into the parent element.Finally append the <form> element to the <body> element of the document. This example creates a Registration form.

** make it a reusable function
** the function will accept 2 parameter
    1. number ( the number of input element)
    2. an object will be passed with element properties, like 
    let elemObj = [
        {
            "type": "text/email/password",
            "name": "dummy_text",
            "placeholder": "dummy_placeholder"
        },
        {
            "type": "text/email/password",
            "name": "dummy_text",
            "placeholder": "dummy_placeholder"
        }
    ]

** testFunction(3, elemObj)
** 

// For this write a function named 



let  input = array["text", "email","password"] Value validation of type property
validation: out of these three types give alert ("input is not allowed")
let inputProperty=["type","value","placeholder"]
if these three property are not given then alert("Not accepted");

Note: To learn javascript as a beginner what are the obstacles and how to overcome it. Write 
your own experience.

*** Task: Make a function to validate the input types initially with creating
the input. (Before running the loop) (improved Type validation )
*** Property or Key Validation
